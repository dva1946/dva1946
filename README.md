- 👋 Hi, I’m @dva1946 (aka Dave Van Abel) retired and living in Manitowoc, WI.
- 👀 I’m interested in Wordpress App development (not plugins).
- 🌱 I’m currently updating previously released very old IPN App for Paypal IPN using PHP.
- 🌱 The IPN App is currently running on my site (9/13/22), but not released or visible to the public.
- 🌱 Release will be on GitHub with full open source code.
- 🌱 In-depth IPN App documentation will be maintained on my website (listed below).
- 🌱 Documentation will be maintained on my website, once released. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to further the use and development of NON-PLUGIN WORDPRESS APPS.
