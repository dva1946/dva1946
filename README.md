- 👋 Hi, I’m @dva1946 (aka Dave Van Abel) retired and living in Manitowoc, WI.
- 👀 I’ve been writing Wordpress Apps since 2019 (not plugins) as an independent developer.
- 🌱 My first Apps were written in 1986 for Savings and Loan Banks.
- 🌱 Now currently updating previously released very old IPN App for Paypal IPN using PHP.
- 🌱 10-25-22 -> The IPN App has now been testedd live and successfuly processed 1,022 recs from PayPal.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to further the use and development of NON-PLUGIN WORDPRESS APPS (known as WpAppsForThat).
- 📫 https://wpappsforthat.com and email dva1946@yahoo.com
- 💞️ [wiki for paypal-ipn](https://github.com/dva1946/paypal-ipn/wiki/Paypal-IPN-App-from-WpAppsForThat.Com) - starting to learn and do documentation of Github Wiki and it looks like a place to do it.
