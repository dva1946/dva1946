- 👋 Hi, I’m @dva1946 (aka Dave Van Abel) retired and living in Manitowoc, WI.
- 👀 I’ve been writing Wordpress Apps since 2019 (not plugins) as an independent developer.
- 🌱 My first Apps were written in 1986 for Savings and Loan Banks.
- 🌱 I’m currently updating previously released very old IPN App for Paypal IPN using PHP.
- 🌱 The IPN App is currently running on my site (9/13/22), and has been released to the public on Sept 26th, 2022.
- 🌱 In-depth IPN App documentation will be maintained on my website (listed below). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to further the use and development of NON-PLUGIN WORDPRESS APPS (known as WpAppForThat).
- 🌱 Have now finished my biggest App and uploaded it. Now busy on finishing documentation. Glad to be contributing!
- 📫 https://wpappsforthat.com and email dva1946@yahoo.com
